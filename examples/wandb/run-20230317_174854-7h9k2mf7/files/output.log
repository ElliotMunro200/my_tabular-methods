/home/elliot/miniconda3/envs/drl_gym_torch/lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py:86: VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated. If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray.
